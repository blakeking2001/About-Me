      <h2>Flying</h2>
      <p>Aviation has always been fascinating to me ever since I was a kid. I would have to say it all started with my uncle being a pilot himself. He used to take me up flying every time i was with him and it got me hooked. Now I decided I was ready to
        become one myself, I am finishing up getting my private pilot license and will be done September 28.</p>
      <br><br><br>Below are some of my favorit pictures taken while flying!</br>

      <h2>Baseball</h2>
      <p>I have been playing Baseball at JC ever since I could in 7th grade. I am a catcher, always have been, and I am a senior.</p>
